    "# Python basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a clear and powerful object-oriented programming language, comparable to Perl, Ruby, Scheme, or Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of Python's notable features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses an elegant syntax, making the programs you write easier to read.\n",
    "- Is an easy-to-use language that makes it simple to get your program working. This makes Python ideal for prototype development and other ad-hoc programming tasks, without compromising maintainability.\n",
    "- Comes with a large standard library that supports many common programming tasks such as connecting to web servers, searching text with regular expressions, reading and modifying files.\n",
    "- Python's interactive mode makes it easy to test short snippets of code. There's also a bundled development environment called IDLE.\n",
    "- Is easily extended by adding new modules implemented in a compiled language such as C or C++.\n",
    "- Can also be embedded into an application to provide a programmable interface.\n",
    "- Runs anywhere, including Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, and Unix, with unofficial builds also available for Android and iOS.\n",
    "- Is free software in two senses. It doesn't cost anything to download or use Python, or to include it in your application. Python can also be freely modified and re-distributed because while the language is copyrighted it's available under an open-source license.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some programming-language features of Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A variety of basic data types are available: numbers (floating point, complex, and unlimited-length long integers), strings (both ASCII and Unicode), lists, and dictionaries.\n",
    "- Python supports object-oriented programming with classes and multiple inheritances.\n",
    "- Code can be grouped into modules and packages.\n",
    "- The language supports raising and catching exceptions, resulting in cleaner error handling.\n",
    "- Data types are strongly and dynamically typed. Mixing incompatible types (e.g. attempting to add a string and a number) causes an exception to be raised, so errors are caught sooner.\n",
    "- Python contains advanced programming features such as generators and list comprehensions.\n",
    "- Python's automatic memory management frees you from having to manually allocate and free memory in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**And most important of all: it is the leading language in Data Science.**"

Here, specific indentations and blank lines between the abovementioned parts apply. For people who have never had to work with such an organization before the code can be surprising, but it quickly becomes understandable and intuitive.\n",

The use of tabs as indentation is also allowed, but spaces are recommended, and in Python 3, the use of spaces and tabs at the same time as indentation is not allowed. Indentation is also used in situations where the code line is too long and must be broken into more lines. The recommended line length according to PEP8 is 79 characters.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from subprocess import Popen, PIPE\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When there are many imports from one module, it is worth to replace it this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from rest_framework.mixins import (\n",
    "    ListModelMixin,\n",
    "    CreateModelMixin,\n",
    "    RetrieveModelMixin,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Imports should be placed at the beginning of the file just after any comments for the module and docstring elements. The order of imports also matters. Here is the recommended order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- import of standard libraries\n",
    "- import of related external libraries (called third party imports)\n",
    "- import of local applications / libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also recommended to add an empty line after each of the above import groups. Since Python allows you to import the entire library or only selected modules of it, you often have to choose the right way for the situation, but usually it is recommended to import and add an alias or import a module instead of e.g. a specific class from this module, which reduces the risk of conflicts in space names . For more information and examples, see the chapter on managing and importing packages.\n",

    "\n",
    "String variables can be placed either in quotation marks or in single quotes because in Python it does not matter. However, PEP8 does not recommend juggling this entry and sticking to one of the options. A situation where it is allowed to use both at the same time is a text string that itself already contains quotation marks or apostrophe - so use the second one. Each of the following entries is valid:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "article = 'Review of \"Lord of the Rings\".'\n",
    "article = \"Review of \\\"Lord of the Rings\\\".\"\n",

    "\n",
    "All binary operators should be surrounded by a single space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we discuss each type of data, it's good to know that Python is a \"dynamically typed\" language. This means that the type of data that will be used to store the value assigned to a variable often depends on the value that will be assigned to the variable, which is significantly different from the way the types are assigned to variables in Java or C ++.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution has both advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantages include the fact that the original type of the variable may change later in the code, which forces the programmer to have more control over what happens with this variable and sometimes you need to use functions that check the type of data transferred. We can not in any way force the method to pass a specific type of data or specify what type of data will be returned. The advantage of dynamic typing is greater language flexibility and the ability to change the type on the fly, which eliminates the need to explicitly declare new variables to store data in the form of another type (explicit and implicit casting).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important piece of information is that Python is an object-oriented language and everything in Python is an object`*`, which is evidenced by the fact that virtually all variables have methods that can be used on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `*` - this statement may not be true if you compare object definitions in other programming languages, but from the point of view of Python and its creators is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing the types of data, it is worth knowing a few operators that are often used in conjunction with variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Arithmetic\n",
    "result = 1 + 2 * 3 / 4.0\n",
    "modulo = 12 % 5\n",
    "square = 5 ** 2\n",

    "\n",
    "Some methods that can be performed on the list object are performed as in-place operations, which means that the operation is performed without returning a new value, so you cannot assign the changed array to another variable. Below is an example with sorting:\n",
