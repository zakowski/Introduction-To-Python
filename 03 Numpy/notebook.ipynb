    "## What is NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. The ancestor of NumPy, Numeric, was originally created by Jim Hugunin with contributions from several other developers. In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy by incorporating features of the competing Numarray into Numeric, with extensive modifications. NumPy is open-source software and has many contributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to install NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "The only prerequisite for NumPy is Python itself. If you don’t have Python yet and want the simplest way to get started, we recommend you use the Anaconda Distribution - it includes Python, NumPy, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science. NumPy can be installed with conda, with pip, or with a package manager on macOS and Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use pip, you can install it with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use conda, you can install it with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numpy basics\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy’s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. In NumPy dimensions are called axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the coordinates of a point in 3D space `[1, 2, 1]` has one axis. That axis has 3 elements in it, so we say it has a length of 3. In the example pictured below, the array has 2 axes. The first axis has a length of 2, the second axis has a length of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[[ 1., 0., 0.],\n",
    " [ 0., 1., 2.]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy’s array class is called `ndarray`. It is also known by the alias array. Note that `numpy.array` is not the same as the Standard Python Library class `array.array`, which only handles one-dimensional arrays and offers less functionality. The more important attributes of an ndarray object are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ndarray.ndim` the number of axes (dimensions) of the array.\n",
    "- `ndarray.shape` the dimensions of the array. This is a tuple of integers indicating the size of the array in each dimension. For a matrix with n rows and m columns, shape will be (n,m). The length of the shape tuple is therefore the number of axes, ndim.\n",
    "- `ndarray.size` the total number of elements of the array. This is equal to the product of the elements of shape.\n",
    "- `ndarray.dtype` an object describing the type of the elements in the array. One can create or specify dtype’s using standard Python types. Additionally NumPy provides types of its own. numpy.int32, numpy.int16, and numpy.float64 are some examples.\n",
    "- `ndarray.itemsize` the size in bytes of each element of the array. For example, an array of elements of type `float64` has itemsize 8 (=64/8), while one of type `complex32` has itemsize 4 (=32/8). It is equivalent to `ndarray.dtype.itemsize`.\n",
    "- `ndarray.data` the buffer containing the actual elements of the array. Normally, we won’t need to use this attribute because we will access the elements in an array using indexing facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> import numpy as np\n",
    ">>> a = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5)\n",
    ">>> a\n",

    "## Array Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to create arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can create an array from a regular Python list or tuple using the array function. The type of the resulting array is deduced from the type of the elements in the sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> import numpy as np\n",
    ">>> a = np.array([2,3,4])\n",
    ">>> a\n",
    "array([2, 3, 4])\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> a.dtype\n",
    "dtype('int64')\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> b = np.array([1.2, 3.5, 5.1])\n",
    ">>> b.dtype\n",
    "dtype('float64')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A frequent error consists in calling array with multiple arguments, rather than providing a single sequence as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = np.array(1,2,3,4)    # WRONG\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "TypeError: array() takes from 1 to 2 positional arguments but 4 were given\n",
    "  \n",
    ">>> a = np.array([1,2,3,4])  # RIGHT\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "array transforms sequences of sequences into two-dimensional arrays, sequences of sequences of sequences into three-dimensional arrays, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> b = np.array([(1.5,2,3), (4,5,6)])\n",
    ">>> b\n",
    "array([[1.5, 2. , 3. ],\n",
    "       [4. , 5. , 6. ]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of the array can also be explicitly specified at creation time:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> c = np.array( [ [1,2], [3,4] ], dtype=complex )\n",
    ">>> c\n",
    "array([[1.+0.j, 2.+0.j],\n",
    "       [3.+0.j, 4.+0.j]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the elements of an array are originally unknown, but its size is known. Hence, NumPy offers several functions to create arrays with initial placeholder content. These minimize the necessity of growing arrays, an expensive operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function zeros creates an array full of zeros, the function ones creates an array full of ones, and the function empty creates an array whose initial content is random and depends on the state of the memory. By default, the dtype of the created array is float64.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> np.zeros((3, 4))\n",
    "array([[0., 0., 0., 0.],\n",
    "       [0., 0., 0., 0.],\n",
    "       [0., 0., 0., 0.]])\n",
    "\n",

    "       [[1, 1, 1, 1],\n",
    "        [1, 1, 1, 1],\n",

    "\n",
    ">>> np.empty( (2,3) ) # uninitialized\n",

    "       [  5.30498948e-313,   3.14673309e-307,   1.00000000e+000]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create sequences of numbers, NumPy provides the arange function which is analogous to the Python built-in range, but returns an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> np.arange( 10, 30, 5 )\n",
    "array([10, 15, 20, 25])\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> np.arange( 0, 2, 0.3 ) # it accepts float arguments\n",
    "array([0. , 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When arange is used with floating point arguments, it is generally not possible to predict the number of elements obtained, due to the finite floating point precision. For this reason, it is usually better to use the function linspace that receives as an argument the number of elements that we want, instead of the step:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from numpy import pi\n",
    ">>> np.linspace( 0, 2, 9 ) # 9 numbers from 0 to 2\n",
    "array([0.  , 0.25, 0.5 , 0.75, 1.  , 1.25, 1.5 , 1.75, 2.  ])\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> x = np.linspace( 0, 2*pi, 100 ) # useful to evaluate function at lots of points\n",
    ">>> f = np.sin(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic operators on arrays apply elementwise. A new array is created and filled with the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = np.array( [20,30,40,50] )\n",
    ">>> b = np.arange( 4 )\n",
    ">>> b\n",

    "array([ True,  True, False, False])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in many matrix languages, the product operator `*` operates elementwise in NumPy arrays. The matrix product can be performed using the `@` operator (in python >=3.5) or the dot function or method:\n",
    "\n",
