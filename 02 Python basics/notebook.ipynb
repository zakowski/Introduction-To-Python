    "\n",
    "```python\n",

Unlike some programming languages, the function signature does not tell us what value we can expect.\n",

    "## Object-oriented Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming - a programming paradigm in which programs are defined by means of objects - elements connecting state (i.e. data, usually called fields) and behavior (i.e. procedures, here: methods). The object-oriented computer program is expressed as a set of such objects that communicate with each other to perform tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach differs from traditional procedural programming, where data and procedures are not directly related to each other. Object-oriented programming is intended to facilitate writing, maintenance and reuse of programs or their fragments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest advantage of programming, design and object-oriented analysis is the compatibility of this approach with reality - _the human brain is naturally best adapted to such an approach when processing information_. (Wikipedia)\n",
    "\n",
    "By way of introduction, I cited the definition of object oriented programming quite concisely and specifically. When designing objects, their methods and connections, we try to model the world around us and transfer virtual reality elements known to us to solve a problem or create a tool for work for us or other people. The design principle also says that objects should be as limited as possible in the range of operations we can perform with them. Let them do relatively little but do it well. It also helps to better understand the program and the relationships between objects, reuse them as well as extend its capabilities and maintain code more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "From general assumptions, we move to the sample class declaration in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\"docstring for module\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",

    "        \"\"\"constructor\"\"\"\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, only one method has been declared called `__init__` which is a constructor. The definition of the method (because that is what the class functions are called) is not much different from the definition of the functions we have already learned. Each method accepts a special argument called self, which means a reference to the object in which it was defined. It is the equivalent of thishnana from other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's expand our class a bit:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\"docstring for module\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    \"\"\"docstring for class\"\"\"\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing that can be noticed here is definitely the lack of access modifiers for both fields and methods of the class because in Python there are no private methods or variables. However, there is a convention that says that prefixing a variable or method with the prefix `_` or `__` means that the variable / method should be treated as private and other developers should not use it, because there is permission to change it without warning. So they are not considered as part of the API. For names from `__`, there is also a mechanism that slightly blurred the visibility of such a variable or method, causing the reference to it to be `_classname_variable`. More information can be found here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.htm.\n",

The second command takes the absolute path and, in addition, the next parameter passes the read mode of the file, which is also read-only here. The letter `r` preceding the path informs Python that it should treat this text string 'literally', i.e. any occurrences of special characters will not be taken into account. which should be preceded by the `\\` character.\n",

    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And here we can notice the first problem if there were Polish letters in the text file. We can overcome this by adding an additional parameter that specifies how the characters to be read should be coded. Remember to close the file handle after reading the data.\n",

This is because the print function adds the character `\\ n` to the end, which means a new line, and if such a character was also read from the file, we have the answer why this is happening. To change this, you can set the value of the `end` parameter of the print function to something other than the default value.\n",
